# Tyre Quality Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting tyre quality based on operational data collected during the manufacturing process. Using machine learning techniques, the goal is to classify tyres as either **high-quality** or **defective**, aiding in the identification of production issues and optimizing quality control.

---

## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict tyre quality based on various production parameters captured by sensors. The model will help in early detection of defects and improve the overall manufacturing process by providing insights into key factors affecting tyre quality.

---

## Data Overview

The dataset contains sensor data and operational parameters from the tyre production process, which include:
- **Production Variables**: Data from machines and sensors used during the tyre manufacturing process.
- **Quality Labels**: Each tyre is labeled as high-quality or defective based on post-production inspection.

---

## Process

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracting and selecting key features that contribute to the tyre quality.
3. **Model Training**: Training machine learning models to predict tyre quality.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy and precision.
